\section{Day 1: Intro (Jan 06, 2026)}

This was taken off the slides from past years.

\subsection{About this Class}

This class is about designing algorithms to solve problems.

We will be:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Designing fast algorithms
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Divide and conquer
            \item Greedy algorithms
            \item Dynamic programming
            \item Network flow
            \item Linear programming
        \end{itemize}
    \item Proving no fast algorithms are likely possible
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reductions and NP-completeness
        \end{itemize}
    \item Solving problems where no fast algorithms are possible
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Approximation algorithms
            \item Randomized algorithms
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

When we analyze an algorithm, we do correctness and running-time proofs.
