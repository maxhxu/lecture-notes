\section{Day 4: Relational Algebra II (Jan 16, 2026)}

We say that natural join is \textbf{commutative} ($R \Join S = S \Join R$), and \textbf{associative} ($R \Join (S \Join T) = (R \Join S) \Join T$), even though the attribute order will vary (this will affect set operations).

The rest of the class was spent working on a worksheet.
