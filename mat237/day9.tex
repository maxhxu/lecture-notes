\section{Day 9: Open and Closed Sets (Sep 22, 2025)}

You should know that there exist sequential formulations equivalent to the definition of closed and open sets.

We want sets that have nice properties: Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. We want a class of sets such that if a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$ converges to $a \in A$, then the \textit{tail} of the sequence belongs in $A$.

\begin{definition}[Open Set]
$A$ is open if every point of $A$ is an interior point of $A$.  
\end{definition}

This is equivalent to saying $A = A^o$, and $A \cap \partial A = \emptyset$.

\begin{definition}[Cloesd Set]
$A$ is closed if every limit point of $A$ belongs to $A$. 
\end{definition}

That is, $A^* \subseteq A$.

\begin{theorem}
    A set $A$ is open if and only if its complement $A^c = \mathbb{R}^n \setminus A$ is closed.
\end{theorem}
