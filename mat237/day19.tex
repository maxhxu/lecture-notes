\section{Day 19: Differentials and Jacobians (Oct 16, 2025)}

Recall that in single var calculus, differentiability at a point implies continuity at a point. Our past few experiments with differentiability, not provide sufficient conditions for continuity at some point. 

\begin{definition}[Differentiable]
$f$ is differentiable at $a$, if there exists a linear map $L : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, such that
\[
    \lim_{ ||h|| \to 0 } \frac{f(a + h) - f(a) - L(h)}{||h||} = 0
\]
$L$ is called \textit{the} differential of $f$ at $a$, written $df_a$. 
\end{definition} 

\noindent The reason we say \textit{the} differential, is because of the fact that differentials of a function at the same point are unique.

\begin{definition}[Jacobian]
The Jacobian of $f$ at $a$ is given by
\[
    Df(a) = [\partial_j f_i(a)]_{i, j} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \mid & & \mid \\
        \partial_1 f(a) & \cdots & \partial_n f(a) \\
        \mid & & \mid
    \end{bmatrix}
\]
\end{definition}

\noindent We have defined differentiability, the differential, as well as the jacobian. The notation $Df(a)$, $df_a$ suggests that they are closely related. We formalize their relationship as follows:

\begin{simplethm} \label{thm:diffproperties}
    If $f$ is differentiable at $A$, then all partial derivatives exist, and the matrix for $df_a$ is the jacobian $Df_a$, with $\partial_i f(a) = df_a(e_i)$.
\end{simplethm}
\begin{proof}
Recall that a linear transformation is uniquely determined by its action on the basis vectors. As per the definition of differentiability,
\[
    0 = \lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(a + he_i) - f(a) - hL(e_i)}{h} = \left[\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(a + he_i) - f(a)}{h}\right] - L(e_i) = \partial_if(a) - L(e_i)
\]
so we can conclude that the partial derivative $\partial_i$ exists by limit law. 
\end{proof}

\noindent If we weren't given $df_a$, but somehow know that $f$ is differentiable at $a$ (hence $df_a$ exists) and given each $\partial_if(a)$ instead, since we know the actions of $df_a$ on the basis vectors, we can retrieve the matrix of $df_a$.
