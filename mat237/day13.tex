\section{Day 13: Path Connected Sets (Oct 06, 2025)}

\begin{definition}[Path-Connectedness]
    A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is path-connected if for all points $p, q \in S$, there exists a continuous function $\gamma: [a, b] \to S$ such that $\gamma(a) = p$, $\gamma(b) = q$, with $\mathrm{im}(\gamma) \subseteq S$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Convex]
    A set $S$ is convex if the line segment between any 2 points in $S$ are contained in $S$.
\end{definition}

See that $f(S)$ for some continuous $f$ is also path connected, since we can use $f \circ \gamma$. 

\begin{simplethm}[IVT]
    Let $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function. If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then $f([a, b])$ is path connected.
\end{simplethm}

$[a, b]$ is path connected, and continuous images of path connected sets are path connected.
