\section{Day 10: Compactness (Sep 23, 2025)}

\begin{definition}[Compactness]
A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is compact if every sequence of $A$ has a subsequence which converges to a point lying inside $A$. 
\end{definition}

This definition is actually for sequentially compact sets. For this reason, our theorem relating compactness to being closed and bounded will actually be the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem instead of the usual Heine-Borel.

\begin{definition}[Boundedness]
    $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is bounded if there exists a $R > 0$, $A \subseteq \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : ||x|| < R \}$.
\end{definition}

Note that the complement of an unbounded set may not be bounded. Yet the complement of a bounded set is always unbounded.

\begin{theorem}[Bolzano-Weierstrass]
A set being compact if and only if it is both closed and bounded.
\end{theorem}
